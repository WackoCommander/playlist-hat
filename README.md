# playlist-hat

stuff to discuss
- using energy (probs at least 80%) instead of bpm for categorisation of playlists. (in particular for plust ultra).
- why skipping tracks for no reason? (just says processing then skips)
- refactor code for better exception handling
- align metadata with spotify better, maybe do a prescan for each artist and change it to the way spotify has it
- also consider offline energy calculating?
