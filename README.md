# playlist-hat

Automatically organising local music into playlists using Spotify's API based on bpm.

Update: No longer using Spotify API because all songs need to follow Spotify's naming convention, to get a quick result. Scrolling through a search list, defeats the purpose of the program to be quick. Instead using plugin from vamp which is really accurate. 

Features to add
- Separate file to sort songs that have already been processed to save time.
- ignore songs that under 1.5 minutes
- Add more categories.
